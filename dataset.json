        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nStep 1: We start by finding the derivative of y with respect to x. The derivative of e^(x/10) can be found using the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. Here, our outer function is e^u and our inner function is x/10.\n\nStep 2: The derivative of e^u with respect to u is simply e^u. So, the derivative of the outer function is e^(x/10).\n\nStep 3: The derivative of x/10 with respect to x is 1/10. So, the derivative of the inner function is 1/10.\n\nStep 4: By the chain rule, the derivative of y with respect to x is the product of the derivatives of the outer and inner functions. Therefore, dy/dx = e^(x/10) * 1/10 = (1/10)e^(x/10).\n\nStep 5: The differential dy is given by dy = (dy/dx)dx.

        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nWe are given the equation (cos(3x))/(x^3) + a + b/(x^2) = 0 and we are asked to find the values of a and b for which this equation holds as x approaches 0.\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, we'll use L'Hopital's rule, which states that the limit of a ratio of two functions as x approaches a certain value is equal to the limit of the ratios of their derivatives. We'll apply this rule to the first term of our equation, (cos(3x))/(x^3).\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator, we get -3sin(3x), and the derivative of the denominator gives us 3x^2. So, the limit of (cos(3x))/(x^3) as x approaches 0 is the same as the limit of (-3sin(3x))/(3x^2) as x approaches 0.\n\nNow, we can simplify this limit by cancelling out the 3s and using the fact that the limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x is 1. This gives us the limit of -sin(3x)/x, which is -1.\n\nNext, we'll look at the second term of our equation, a. Since a is a constant, its limit as x approaches any value is just a.\n\nFinally, we'll look at the third term, b/(x^2). Again using L'Hopital's rule, we find that the limit of b/(x^2) as x approaches 0 is the same as the limit of 0/(2x), which is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we find that the limit of our equation as x approaches 0 is -1 + a + 0 = 0. Solving for a, we find that a = 1.\n\nNow, let's substitute a = 1 into the original equation and solve for b. We get (cos(3x))/(x^3) + 1 + b/(x^2) = 0. \n\nAgain, we'll use L'Hopital's rule on the first and third terms. The limit of (cos(3x))/(x^3) as x approaches 0 is -1, as we found earlier. The limit of b/(x^2) as x approaches 0 is 0. So, the limit of the equation as x approaches 0 is -1 + 1 + 0 = 0.\n\nThis means that the equation holds for all values of x as x approaches 0 when a = 1 and b can be any real number.\n\nAnswer: a = 1, b ∈ R."

        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x). By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if we have a function defined by an integral with a variable upper limit, the derivative of that function with respect to that variable is just the integrand evaluated at the upper limit. So, f'(x) = sqrt(1+sin^2(2x)) * derivative of sin2x = 2cos(2x)sqrt(1+sin^2(2x)).\n\nNext, we find the derivative of g(y). Again using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we find that g'(y) = f(y). \n\nNow, to find g''(y), we need to take the derivative of g'(y) = f(y). But we know that f(y) = f'(y) = 2cos(2y)sqrt(1+sin^2(2y)). So, g''(y) = f'(y) = 2cos(2y)sqrt(1+sin^2(2y)).\n\nFinally, we substitute y = pi/6 into g''(y) to find g''(pi/6) = 2cos(pi/3)sqrt(1+sin^2(pi/3)).\n\nAnswer: g''(pi/6) = 2cos(pi/3)sqrt(1+sin^2(pi/3))."

L'Hospital's Rule states that the limit of a quotient of two functions, both of which are approaching 0 or ∞, is equal to the limit of the quotients of their derivatives.\n\nHere, we have a limit of the form 0/0, since as x goes to 0, both the numerator and the denominator go to 0. \n\nThe function in the numerator is the integral of (2t)/(t^3+2) from 0 to x, and the function in the denominator is 1/x^3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator is found by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if a function f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], then the integral of f from a to b is equal to F(b) - F(a). \n\nIn this case, f(t) = (2t)/(t^3+2), so we need to find an antiderivative of f. This can be done by using the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n dx is (1/(n+1))x^(n+1). \n\nThe antiderivative of f(t) is (1/2)ln(t^3+2).
