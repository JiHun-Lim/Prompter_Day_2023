        "Solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the double-angle identity for cosine, which states that cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ. We will also use the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 to find the value of cosθ.\n\nStep 1: Let θ = sin^-1(5/13). This means that sinθ = 5/13.\n\nStep 2: Use the Pythagorean identity to find cosθ. We know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so we can solve for cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - (5/13)² = 1 - 25/169 = 144/169. Therefore, cosθ = √(144/169) = 12/13.\n\nStep 3: Use the double-angle identity for cosine. We want to find cos(2θ), which is equal to 1 - 2sin²θ. Substituting sinθ = 5/13, we get cos(2θ) = 1 - 2*(5/13)² = 1 - 2*(25/169) = 1 - 50/169 = 119/169.\n\nSo, the exact value of cos(2sin^-1(5/13)) = 119/169.",

The square root function, f(x) = sqrt(x), is a good choice because we can easily compute the square root of 100, which is close to 100.5.\n\nNext, we find the derivative of f(x) = sqrt(x), which is f'(x) = 1/(2sqrt(x)). \n\nThen, we find the equation of the tangent line at the point where x = 100.

        "Problem": "If f(x) = integral sqrt(1+t^2)dt from 0 to sinx and g(y) = integral f(x) from 3 to y. Find g''(pi/6)",
        "Answer": "(sqrt(3)/2) * sqrt(1+pi^2/36)",
        "Solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Chain Rule.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x). According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if a function f(x) is defined as an integral from a to x of a function g(t) dt, then the derivative of f(x) is just g(x). Therefore, f'(x) = sqrt(1+sin^2(x)) * cos(x). The cos(x) comes from the derivative of the upper limit of the integral, sin(x).\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of g(y). Again, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, g'(y) = f(y).\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of g(y), which is g''(y). To do this, we take the derivative of g'(y) = f(y). Using the Chain Rule, we have g''(y) = f'(y) = sqrt(1+sin^2(y)) * cos(y).\n\nFinally, we substitute y = pi/6 into g''(y) to find g''(pi/6). So, g''(pi/6) = sqrt(1+sin^2(pi/6)) * cos(pi/6) = sqrt(1+(1/2)^2) * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(5/4) * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(15)/4.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is g''(pi/6) = sqrt(15)/4.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nThe given problem is asking to evaluate the limit of a function that is in the form of 0/0 as x approaches 0. This is an indeterminate form, so we can use L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate the limit.\n\nL'Hopital's Rule states that if the limit of a function as x approaches a certain value is in the form of 0/0 or ∞/∞, then the limit of that function is equal to the limit of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator.\n\nThe function we are given is (1/x^2) * integral (2t)/(sqrt(t^3+1))dt from 0 to x. \n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator.\n\nThe derivative of the numerator, which is the integral from 0 to x of (2t)/(sqrt(t^3+1))dt, is just the integrand evaluated at x, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. So, the derivative of the numerator is (2x)/(sqrt(x^3+1)).\n\nThe derivative of the denominator, 1/x^2, is -2/x^3.\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. The limit as x approaches 0 of our function is equal to the limit as x approaches 0 of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator.\n\nSo, we have lim (x->0) [(2x)/(sqrt(x^3+1))] / [-2/x^3]. \n\nSimplifying this, we get lim (x->0) [-x^4/(sqrt(x^3+1))].\n\nAs x approaches 0, the numerator and the denominator of this function both approach 0. So, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule again.\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator, we get -4x^3.\n\nTaking the derivative of the denominator, we get 1/(2sqrt(x^3+1)) * 3x^2, by the chain rule.\n\nSo, we have lim (x->0) [-4x^3] / [1/(2sqrt(x^3+1)) * 3x^2].\n\nSimplifying this, we get lim (x->0) [-8x/(3sqrt(x^3+1))].\n\nAs x approaches 0, this function approaches -8/3.\n\nSo, the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/x^2) * integral (2t)/(sqrt(t^3+1))dt from 0 to x is -8/3.\n\nAnswer: -8/3.",

        "Answer": "f(x) = x*sqrt(x), a = 9",
        "Solution": "First, let's recognize that the given equation is in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if a function f is continuous over the interval [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], then the definite integral from a to b of f(t) dt is F(b) - F(a).\n\nThe equation given is 6 + integral f(t)/(t^2)dt from a to x = 2sqrt(x). \n\nLet's isolate the integral on one side of the equation:\n\nintegral f(t)/(t^2)dt from a to x = 2sqrt(x) - 6.\n\nNow, we need to find a function F(x) whose derivative is f(x) = F'(x) and satisfies the equation. \n\nWe know that the derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2sqrt(x)), and the derivative of a constant is 0. So, the derivative of 2sqrt(x) - 6 is 1/sqrt(x).\n\nWe want our function f(t) to be divided by t^2 in the integral, so we set f(t) = t^2 * F'(t) = t^2 / sqrt(t) = t^(3/2).\n\nNow, we need to find the number a. We know that the integral from a to x of f(t) dt is F(x) - F(a). So, we set F(a) = 6, because when we plug in a for x in the original equation, we get 6 on the left side.\n\nSo, we have F(x) = 2sqrt(x) and F(a) = 6. Solving for a gives us a = (6/2)^2 = 9.\n\nSo, the function f and the number a that satisfy the given equation are f(t) = t^(3/2) and a = 9.",
