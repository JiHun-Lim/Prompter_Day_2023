We will also use the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 to find the value of cosθ.\n\nStep 1: Let θ = sin^-1(5/13). This means that sinθ = 5/13.\n\nStep 2: Use the Pythagorean identity to find cosθ. We know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so we can solve for cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - (5/13)² = 1 - 25/169 = 144/169. Therefore, cosθ = √(144/169) = 12/13.\n\nStep 3: Use the double-angle identity for cosine. We want to find cos(2θ), which is equal to 1 - 2sin²θ. Substituting sinθ = 5/13, we get cos(2θ) = 1 - 2*(5/13)² = 1 - 2*(25/169) = 1 - 50/169 = 119/169.\n\nSo, the exact value of cos(2sin^-1(5/13)) = 119/169.",

Since they start and finish the race at the same time, we have f(0) = g(0) and f(T) = g(T), where T is the time they finish the race.\n\nWe know that the position functions of the runners are continuous and differentiable (since the runners move in a continuous and smooth way).

Therefore, f'(t1) = g'(t2).\n\nThis means that at some time during the race, the two runners have the same speed. However, this does not necessarily mean that they have the same speed at the same time. To prove this, we can consider the function h(t) = f(t) - g(t).

But h'(t) = f'(t) - g'(t), so f'(t3) = g'(t3).\n\nTherefore, at some time t3 during the race, the two runners have the same speed at the same time.\n\nAnswer: At some point during the race, the two runners have the same speed.",

So, the derivative of the numerator is (2x)/(sqrt(x^3+1)).\n\nThe derivative of the denominator, 1/x^2, is -2/x^3.\n\nNow, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. The limit as x approaches 0 of our function is equal to the limit as x approaches 0 of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator.\n\nSo, we have lim (x->0) [(2x)/(sqrt(x^3+1))] / [-2/x^3]. \n\nSimplifying this, we get lim (x->0) [-x^4/(sqrt(x^3+1))].\n\nAs x approaches 0, the numerator and the denominator of this function both approach 0. So, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule again.\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator, we get -4x^3.\n\nTaking the derivative of the denominator, we get 1/(2sqrt(x^3+1)) * 3x^2, by the chain rule.\n\nSo, we have lim (x->0) [-4x^3] / [1/(2sqrt(x^3+1)) * 3x^2].\n\nSimplifying this, we get lim (x->0) [-8x/(3sqrt(x^3+1))].\n\nAs x approaches 0, this function approaches -8/3.\n\nSo, the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/x^2) * integral (2t)/(sqrt(t^3+1))dt from 0 to x is -8/3.\n\nAnswer: -8/3.",

        "Answer": "f(x) = x*sqrt(x), a = 9",
        "Solution": "First, let's recognize that the given equation is in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if a function f is continuous over the interval [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], then the definite integral from a to b of f(t) dt is F(b) - F(a).\n\nThe equation given is 6 + integral f(t)/(t^2)dt from a to x = 2sqrt(x). \n\nLet's isolate the integral on one side of the equation:\n\nintegral f(t)/(t^2)dt from a to x = 2sqrt(x) - 6.\n\nNow, we need to find a function F(x) whose derivative is f(x) = F'(x) and satisfies the equation. \n\nWe know that the derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2sqrt(x)), and the derivative of a constant is 0. So, the derivative of 2sqrt(x) - 6 is 1/sqrt(x).\n\nWe want our function f(t) to be divided by t^2 in the integral, so we set f(t) = t^2 * F'(t) = t^2 / sqrt(t) = t^(3/2).\n\nNow, we need to find the number a. We know that the integral from a to x of f(t) dt is F(x) - F(a). So, we set F(a) = 6, because when we plug in a for x in the original equation, we get 6 on the left side.\n\nSo, we have F(x) = 2sqrt(x) and F(a) = 6. Solving for a gives us a = (6/2)^2 = 9.\n\nSo, the function f and the number a that satisfy the given equation are f(t) = t^(3/2) and a = 9.",
