        "Answer": "-1/xsqrt(x^2-1) + 1/sqrt(1-x^2)",
        "Solution": "To find the derivative of this function, we first need to recognize that the derivative of the inverse cosecant function, csc^-1(x), is -1/(|x|sqrt(x^2 - 1)). We also need to know the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composition of functions is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nLet's start with the first term, csc^-1(x). By the rule we mentioned, its derivative will be -1/(|x|sqrt(x^2 - 1)). \n\nNow let's take a look at the second term, csc^-1(1/x). This is a composition of functions, so we will need to use the chain rule. The outer function is csc^-1(u), and its derivative is -1/(|u|sqrt(u^2 - 1)), where u is the inner function. The inner function here is 1/x, and its derivative is -1/x^2.\n\nBy the chain rule, the derivative of csc^-1(1/x) is the product of these two derivatives, which gives us [1/(x^2)] * [-1/(|1/x|sqrt((1/x)^2 - 1))]. \n\nSimplify this to get -1/(x^2*|1/x|sqrt((1/x)^2 - 1)). \n\nNow, |1/x| is just 1/|x|, and (1/x)^2 - 1 can be rewritten as 1/x^2 - 1.

The derivative of a composition of functions can be found using the chain rule.\n\nStep 2: Apply the chain rule. The derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx = (dy/du) * (du/dv) * (dv/dx), where u = sqrt((1-x)/(4+x)), v = (1-x)/(4+x), and y = tan^-1(u).\n\nStep 3: Find dy/du. The derivative of the inverse tangent function is 1/(1+u^2). So, dy/du = 1/(1+u^2).\n\nStep 4: Find du/dv. The derivative of the square root function is 1/(2*sqrt(v)). So, du/dv = 1/(2*sqrt(v)).\n\nStep 5: Find dv/dx. The derivative of the rational function is found using the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator. So, dv/dx = [-(4+x) - (1-x)]/((4+x)^2) = -2x/(4+x)^2.\n\nStep 6: Substitute dy/du, du/dv, and dv/dx into the chain rule formula to find dy/dx. dy/dx = [1/(1+u^2)] * [1/(2*sqrt(v))] * [-2x/(4+x)^2].\n\nStep 7: Substitute u and v back into the equation to get dy/dx in terms of x. dy/dx = [1/(1+((1-x)/(4+x)))^2] * [1/(2*sqrt((1-x)/(4+x)))] * [-2x/(4+x)^2].\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation.

Here, a is the point of approximation (27), f(a) is the function value at a (3), and f'(a) is the derivative at a (1/81). \n\nSubstitute these values into the formula to get L(x) = 3 + (1/81)(x - 27).\n\nStep 6: Estimate the given number\nSubstitute x = 27.1 into the linear approximation function to get L(27.1) = 3 + (1/81)(27.1 - 27) = 3 + 0.0012345679 = 3.0012345679.\n\nSo, the cube root of 27.1 is approximately 3.0012345679.\n\nAnswer: 3.0012345679.",

        "Answer": "961/240",
        "Solution": "First, we need to find a function that we can use to approximate the cube root of 64.2. The function f(x) = x^(1/3) (the cube root of x) seems appropriate, and we know its derivative is f'(x) = (1/3)x^(-2/3).\n\nNext, we choose a number close to 64.2 that we can easily take the cube root of. The number 64 seems appropriate, since the cube root of 64 is 4.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for linear approximation, which is L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a), where a is the number we chose (64) and x is the number we're trying to estimate the cube root of (64.2).\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nL(x) = f(64) + f'(64)(64.2 - 64)\n     = 64^(1/3) + (1/3) * 64^(-2/3) * (64.2 - 64)\n     = 4 + (1/3) * (1/16) * (0.2)\n     = 4 + 0.00416666666\n\nSo, the cube root of 64.2 is approximately 4 + 0.00416666666 = 4.00416666666.\n\nNow, we convert the decimal to a fraction for the final answer. The decimal 0.00416666666 is approximately 1/240 when converted to a fraction. \n\nSo, the cube root of 64.2 is approximately 4 + 1/240 = 961/240.",

So, the derivative of the outer function is 1/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)).\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to find the derivative of the inner function with respect to x. The derivative of cos(x) with respect to x is -sin(x). The derivative of sqrt(u) with respect to u is 1/(2sqrt(u)), so the derivative of sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1) with respect to x is cos(x)*(-sin(x))/(2sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)) = -sin(x)cos(x)/sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1).\n\nStep 5: So, the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is -sin(x) + -sin(x)cos(x)/sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the derivative of y with respect to x is the product of the derivatives of the outer and inner functions, which is (1/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)))*(-sin(x) + -sin(x)cos(x)/sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)).\n\nStep 7: Simplifying this expression, we get dy/dx = -sin(x)/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)) - sin(x)cos(x)/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1))*sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1).\n\nAnswer: dy/dx = -sin(x)/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1)) - sin(x)cos(x)/(cos(x) + sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1))*sqrt(cos^2(x) - 1).",

        "Problem": "Use L'Hospital's Rule to evaluate the limit of (1/x^3) * integral (3t^2)/(sqrt(t^2+1))dt from 0 to x where x goes to 0.",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Solution": "Chain of thoughts:\n\n1. First recognize that the problem is asking for the limit as x approaches 0. This is a classic case to use L'Hospital's Rule since it's in the form of 0/0 or ∞/∞. \n\n2. L'Hospital's rule states that the limit of a ratio of two functions, where both are either going to 0 or ∞, is the same as the limit of the ratio of their derivatives.\n\n3. The function at the numerator is an integral from 0 to x, so by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, its derivative will be the integrand evaluated at x. \n\n4. The derivative at the denominator is simply 3x^2.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps:\n\n- First, differentiate the numerator with respect to x using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The derivative of the integral from 0 to x of f(t) dt is simply f(x). So, we get (3x^2)/(sqrt(x^2+1)).\n\n- Next, differentiate the denominator with respect to x. The derivative of x^3 is 3x^2.\n\n- Now that we have the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we can apply L'Hospital's Rule. This gives us the new limit:\n\nlim (x->0) (3x^2)/(sqrt(x^2+1)) / 3x^2 \n\n- We can simplify this expression by canceling out the 3x^2 from the numerator and denominator:\n\nlim (x->0) 1/(sqrt(x^2+1))\n\n- As x approaches 0, the expression inside the square root approaches 1, so the limit is 1/1, which equals 1.\n\nSo, the limit of {integral (3t^2)/(sqrt(t^2+1))dt from 0 to x} / x^3 as x approaches 0 is 1.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nThe problem involves an indeterminate form of type 0/0. So, L'Hospital's rule can be applied.\n\nFirst, we express the limit as limit as x goes to 0 {integral (2t)/(sqrt(t^2+1))dt from 0 to x}/x^2.\n\nBy L'Hospital's Rule, this is equal to the limit as x goes to 0 of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator.\n\nThe derivative of the denominator, x^2, is 2x.\n\nThe derivative of the integral from 0 to x of (2t)/(sqrt(t^2+1)) dt is just the integrand evaluated at x, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. So it's (2x)/(sqrt(x^2+1)).\n\nSo, the original limit is equal to the limit as x goes to 0 of (2x)/(sqrt(x^2+1)) / 2x.\n\nThe 2x in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving us with the limit as x goes to 0 of 1/sqrt(x^2+1).\n\nAs x goes to 0, this becomes 1/sqrt(0+1), which simplifies to 1.\n\nSo, the original limit is 1. \n\nAnswer: 1.",

        "Answer": "3/2sqrt(2)",
        "Solution": "We are given the problem to evaluate the limit of the integral from 0 to x of (3t)/(sqrt(t^3+2)) dt divided by x^2 as x goes to 0. \n\nThe first step is to recognize that this is an indeterminate form of 0/0. In order to apply L'Hospital's rule, we need to take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator.\n\nL'Hospital's rule states that if the limit of a function as x approaches a certain value results in an indeterminate form 0/0 or ∞/∞, then the limit of this function is equal to the limit of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator.\n\n1. Take the derivative of the numerator. Using the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the derivative of an integral from a constant to a variable of a function is just the function evaluated at that variable.\n\n   So, the derivative of the integral from 0 to x of (3t)/(sqrt(t^3+2)) dt is just (3x)/(sqrt(x^3+2)).\n\n2. Take the derivative of the denominator using the power rule. The derivative of x^2 is 2x.\n\n3. Now we have a new limit: the limit as x goes to 0 of [(3x)/(sqrt(x^3+2))]/(2x).\n\n4. Simplify the expression by cancelling out the 'x' in the numerator and the denominator, we get: \n\n   limit as x goes to 0 of [3/(2*sqrt(x^3+2))].\n\n5. Now, as x goes to 0, the expression becomes 3/(2*sqrt(2)), which is a constant.\n\nSo, the limit of the original expression as x goes to 0 is 3/(2*sqrt(2)).\n\nHence, the answer is 3/(2*sqrt(2)).",
