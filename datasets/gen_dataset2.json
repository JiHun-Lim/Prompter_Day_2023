        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nStep 1: We know that cos^-1(3/5) is an angle whose cosine is 3/5. Let's call this angle θ. So, cos(θ) = 3/5.\n\nStep 2: We need to find sin(2θ). We can use the double angle formula for sine, which is sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ).\n\nStep 3: We know the value of cos(θ), but we don't know the value of sin(θ). To find sin(θ), we can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1. Solving for sin(θ), we get sin(θ) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(θ)).\n\nStep 4: Substituting cos(θ) = 3/5 into the equation, we get sin(θ) = sqrt(1 - (3/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/25) = sqrt(16/25) = 4/5.\n\nStep 5: Now we can substitute sin(θ) = 4/5 and cos(θ) = 3/5 into the double angle formula.

To find the derivative, we will use the product rule for the term xy and the chain rule for the term e^y.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of two functions multiplied together is the first function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the derivative of the first function. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nApplying these rules, we get:\n\ny' = dy/dx = - (x dy/dx + e^y) / (y + e^y dy/dx)\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivative, y''. To do this, we will differentiate the first derivative with respect to x. \n\ny'' = d^2y/dx^2 = - [(x d^2y/dx^2 + dy/dx + e^y dy/dx + e^y d^2y/dx^2) / (y + e^y dy/dx + e^y d^2y/dx^2)]\n\nNow, we substitute x = 1 into the equation to find the value of y'' at the point where x = 1. \n\ny''(1) = - [(1 d^2y/dx^2 + dy/dx + e^y dy/dx + e^y d^2y/dx^2) / (y + e^y dy/dx + e^y d^2y/dx^2)]\n\nThis is the value of the second derivative at the point where x = 1.\n\nHowever, this problem is a bit tricky because we have y' and y'' in the equation. To solve this, we need to find the value of y and y' at the point x = 1 from the original equation and the first derivative equation. \n\nLet's solve the original equation for y when x = 1:\n\n1*y + e^y = 2\n\nWe can solve this equation for y using numerical methods or graphically, as it doesn't have a simple algebraic solution. Let's say the solution is y = a.\n\nThen we substitute x = 1 and y = a into the first derivative equation to find y':\n\ny'(1) = - (1*a + e^a) / (a + e^a*a)\n\nLet's say y'(1) = b.\n\nFinally, we substitute x = 1, y = a, y' = b into the second derivative equation:\n\ny''(1) = - [(1*b + b + e^a*b + e^a*b) / (a + e^a*b + e^a*b)]\n\nAfter simplifying, we get the value of y''(1).\n\nNote: The actual numerical value of y''(1) depends on the numerical value of y = a, which can be obtained by solving the equation 1*y + e^y = 2."

This gives us 31*pi/180 radians.\n\nStep 3: Now we need to find a value close to 31*pi/180 that we can easily compute the sine of. The closest value we know the sine of is pi/6, which is approximately 30*pi/180.\n\nStep 4: We can use the linear approximation formula, which is f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a), where f(x) is the function we're approximating, a is the point we're approximating around, and f'(x) is the derivative of the function.\n\nStep 5: In this case, f(x) = sin(x), a = pi/6, and f'(x) = cos(x).

We'll apply this rule to the first term of our equation, (cos(3x))/(x^3).\n\nTaking the derivative of the numerator, we get -3sin(3x), and the derivative of the denominator gives us 3x^2. So, the limit of (cos(3x))/(x^3) as x approaches 0 is the same as the limit of (-3sin(3x))/(3x^2) as x approaches 0.\n\nNow, we can simplify this limit by cancelling out the 3s and using the fact that the limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x is 1.

        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nThe problem involves finding the derivative of a function that is defined as a definite integral. The limits of the integral are functions of x, not constants. Therefore, we will use the Leibniz rule (also known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1) which states that the derivative of an integral of a function with respect to its limits is just the function evaluated at these limits times the derivatives of the limits.\n\nThe Leibniz rule is written as follows:\n\nd/dx ∫[a(x), b(x)] f(t) dt = f(b(x)) * b'(x) - f(a(x)) * a'(x)\n\nIn our case, the function f(u) is (u^2-2)/(u^2+1), the lower limit a(x) is x, and the upper limit b(x) is 3x. \n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of the limits: a'(x) = 1 and b'(x) = 3.\n\nNext, we substitute the limits into the function f(u):\n\nf(a(x)) = f(x) = (x^2-2)/(x^2+1)\n\nf(b(x)) = f(3x) = ((3x)^2-2)/((3x)^2+1) = (9x^2-2)/(9x^2+1)\n\nNow, we can apply the Leibniz rule:\n\nl'(x) = f(b(x)) * b'(x) - f(a(x)) * a'(x) = (9x^2-2)/(9x^2+1) * 3 - (x^2-2)/(x^2+1) * 1\n\nSo, the derivative of the function l(x) is l'(x) = 3*(9x^2-2)/(9x^2+1) - (x^2-2)/(x^2+1)."

        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nWe are given the equation 4 + ∫f(t)/(t^3) dt from a to x = sqrt(x) for all x > 0. \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as ∫f(t)/(t^3) dt from a to x = sqrt(x) - 4. \n\nNow, we can differentiate both sides with respect to x using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus on the left side and the power rule on the right side. \n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if a function f is continuous over the interval [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], then ∫f(t) dt from a to b = F(b) - F(a). \n\nSo, the derivative of the left side is f(x)/(x^3). \n\nThe power rule states that the derivative of x^n with respect to x is n*x^(n-1). \n\nSo, the derivative of the right side is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) - 0 = 1/(2*sqrt(x)).\n\nSetting these two derivatives equal to each other, we get f(x)/(x^3) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)).\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^3, we get f(x) = x^3/(2*sqrt(x)) = x^(3/2)/2.\n\nFinally, we need to find a value for a. \n\nSubstituting x = a in the original equation, we get 4 + ∫f(t)/(t^3) dt from a to a = sqrt(a) - 4.\n\nBut the integral from a to a is 0, so we get 4 = sqrt(a) - 4.\n\nSolving for a, we get a = (4+4)^2 = 64.\n\nSo, the function f and the number a that satisfy the given equation are f(x) = x^(3/2)/2 and a = 64."

        "Solution": "Solution:\n\nThe problem is asking us to find a function f and a number a such that the integral of f(t)/(t^2) from a to x plus 5 equals 4sqrt(x) for all x > 0. \n\nTo solve this, we can first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the integral on one side:\n\nintegral f(t)/(t^2)dt from a to x = 4sqrt(x) - 5.\n\nNext, we can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x. The derivative of the left side, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, is simply f(x)/x^2.
