  'Answer': '119/169',
  'Solution': 'To solve this problem, we will use the double-angle identity for cosine, which states that cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ. We will also use the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 to find the value of cosθ.\n\nStep 1: Let θ = sin^-1(5/13). This means that sinθ = 5/13.\n\nStep 2: Use the Pythagorean identity to find cosθ. We know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so we can solve for cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - (5/13)² = 1 - 25/169 = 144/169. Therefore, cosθ = √(144/169) = 12/13.\n\nStep 3: Use the double-angle identity for cosine. We want to find cos(2θ), which is equal to 1 - 2sin²θ. Substituting sinθ = 5/13, we get cos(2θ) = 1 - 2*(5/13)² = 1 - 2*(25/169) = 1 - 50/169 = 119/169.\n\nSo, the exact value of cos(2sin^-1(5/13)) = 119/169.',

This gives us ln(y) = ln((2x)^(1/x)).\n\nStep 3: Using the property of logarithms that allows us to bring the exponent to the front, we get ln(y) = (1/x) * ln(2x).\n\nStep 4: Now we differentiate both sides with respect to x. The left side becomes 1/y * y', where y' is the derivative of y with respect to x. The right side becomes a bit more complex due to the quotient rule and chain rule. \n\nStep 5: Differentiating (1/x) gives us -1/x^2. Differentiating ln(2x) gives us 1/(2x) * 2 = 1/x. \n\nStep 6: Applying the product rule to the right side, we get -1/x^2 * ln(2x) + 1/x * 1/x = -ln(2x)/x^2 + 1/x^2.\n\nStep 7: So, we have 1/y * y' = -ln(2x)/x^2 + 1/x^2.\n\nStep 8: To find y', we multiply both sides by y, giving us y' = y * (-ln(2x)/x^2 + 1/x^2).\n\nStep 9: Substituting y = (2x)^(1/x) back into the equation, we get y' = (2x)^(1/x) * (-ln(2x)/x^2 + 1/x^2).\n\nSo, the derivative of the function y = (2x)^(1/x) is y' = (2x)^(1/x) * (-ln(2x)/x^2 + 1/x^2)."},

  'Solution': "Problem: Find the derivative of y = sin(x^2).\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(x) and the inner function is x^2.\n\nStep 2: Apply the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. \n\nStep 3: Differentiate the outer function. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x).\n\nStep 4: Differentiate the inner function. The derivative of x^2 is 2x.\n\nStep 5: Multiply the derivatives from steps 3 and 4 according to the chain rule. This gives us (cos(x^2))(2x).\n\nSo, the derivative of y = sin(x^2) is y' = 2x cos(x^2)."},

  'Solution': 'Solution:\n\nStep 1: We start by taking the natural logarithm on both sides of the equation to simplify the expression. This gives us ln(y) = ln((3x)^(1/3x)).\n\nStep 2: We then use the property of logarithms that allows us to bring the exponent to the front, which gives us ln(y) = (1/3x) * ln(3x).\n\nStep 3: Now we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x. The derivative of ln(y) with respect to y is 1/y, and we multiply this by dy/dx (using the chain rule) to give us dy/dx = (1/y) * dy/dx.\n\nStep 4: On the right-hand side, we have a product of two functions (1/3x and ln(3x)), so we use the product rule for differentiation. The derivative of (1/3x) with respect to x is -1/3x^2, and the derivative of ln(3x) with respect to x is 1/x. So, the derivative of the right-hand side is (-1/3x^2) * ln(3x) + (1/3x) * (1/x).\n\nStep 5: We then multiply both sides of the equation by y to isolate dy/dx on the left-hand side, which gives us dy/dx = y * [(-1/3x^2) * ln(3x) + (1/3x) * (1/x)].\n\nStep 6: Finally, we substitute y = (3x)^(1/3x) back into the equation to get dy/dx = (3x)^(1/3x) * [(-1/3x^2) * ln(3x) + (1/3x) * (1/x)].\n\nAnswer: dy/dx = (3x)^(1/3x) * [(-1/3x^2) * ln(3x) + (1/3x) * (1/x)].'},
